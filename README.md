# Dumb Assortment of Favorite Tracks

A dumb script for making playlists containing your last 50 liked tracks, and 50 random tracks from your liked list.

Requires [Spotipy](https://pypi.org/project/spotipy/).

## Setup

Modify `props.json` with your own data. You should follow the Spotipy "[Getting Started](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/#getting-started)" to get your Spotify client id, client secret, and redirect URI.
